# DiscordBot

## About this Project

This project is not an usual project. It was more like a challenge I accepted because I thought it could be helpful in future. This challenge consisted to build a functional Discord Bot using any programming language and any library within 2 days.

This Bot uses the [JDA (Java Discord API)](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) library. I still had 5 hours left when I made my last changes, but already included some core functions and Commands. There is always a way to enhance code, but I do not have any plans to work on this any more. Maybe in a year I will come back to this project, rewrite the whole Discord Bot and spend much more time on writing more efficient and clean code.

But since it is fairly easy to add a command to this Bot, I probably just will add some very small commands which could help me in my daily life (or for other Projects). 

The Bot contains for instance this [ModulePack Compiling Command](https://github.com/jaqxues/DiscordBot/blob/master/src/main/java/com/jaqxues/discordbot/bot/commands/CompileModPackCommand.java) which works with a slightly modified version of the original ModulePack_Compiler.bat file. It makes compiling and signing a [SnapTools](https://github.com/jaqxues/SnapTools) ModulePack a lot easier and saves a lot of time (and copy pasting).
